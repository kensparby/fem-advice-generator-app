## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- CSS Modules

### Continued development

I'd like to make the transition from the loading component to the advice showing up smoother, but I'm blanking out right now. Maybe another day.
